All things in Ruby are Objects! 

Ruby is an interpretive language 

irb (enter) - gets you into Rubys node thing 

#Comments or =begin =end (must be on their own lines, no spaces after the words)

Levels of Abstraction
Ruby programers use ruby languages to build higher level languages called 'Domain Specifiic Languages or DSL' 
like Rails or RSpec

Variables 
Local var start with a lowercase letter, other start with $ or @
Variable names are separated by underscore: my_name = “annah’


Methods 

String Methods
.reverse - got for reversing a list from high to low 
.length - same as JS
.capatalize - obvious
.upcase - all letter upcase 
.downcase - all lowercase

! => Bang 
Bang methods are considered dangerous they ulter the method, can also be applied to any method
A bang returns a nil not a string

Start methods (functions) with a def and it ends with an end
